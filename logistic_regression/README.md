## Section 1: Intro to Logistic Regression

In this section, we will introduce logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm used in machine learning. Logistic regression is specifically designed for binary classification tasks, where the target variable can take only two possible classes. We will explore the underlying principles of logistic regression and its applications in various real-world scenarios.

## Section 2: Logistic Parametric Function

Logistic regression employs a parametric function known as the sigmoid function, which maps the input features to probabilities in the range [0, 1]. In this section, we will delve into the logistic parametric function and understand how it is utilized to model the relationship between the input features and the probability of the binary outcome.

## Section 3: Optimizing Logistic Regression Parameters

Finding the optimal parameters for the logistic regression model is crucial for accurate classification. In this section, we will explore the process of optimizing logistic regression parameters. Common optimization techniques, such as gradient descent or Newton's method, will be discussed, along with their role in achieving the best classification performance.

## Section 4: Model Evaluation: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)

Evaluating the performance of a logistic regression model is essential to assess its predictive capabilities. In this section, we will focus on model evaluation using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve provides valuable insights into the model's ability to distinguish between the two classes, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric quantifies its overall performance.
