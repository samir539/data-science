## Section 1: Dataset Loading

Before we delve into decision trees and random forests, we need to load and prepare the dataset. Dataset loading involves importing necessary libraries, reading the data from a file or an external source, and preprocessing the data to handle missing values, scaling, or encoding categorical features, depending on the nature of the data.

## Section 2: Intro to Decision Trees and GINI-index

In this section, we will introduce decision trees, a powerful machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. Decision trees partition the feature space into regions, making binary decisions at each node based on the input features. We will also explore the concept of GINI-index, a measure used to evaluate the quality of a split in decision trees.

## Section 3: Decision Tree Training

The training process of a decision tree involves recursively partitioning the dataset into subsets by selecting the best split at each node. The selection of the best split is often based on criteria like GINI-index or Information Gain. In this section, we will learn how decision trees are trained to create an optimal tree structure.

## Section 4: Decision Tree Classification Algorithm

Once the decision tree is trained, it can be used to classify new data points. In this section, we will explore the decision tree classification algorithm, where the input features are traversed through the tree to make predictions based on the learned rules at each node. We will understand how the decision tree reaches the leaf node, representing the final classification.

## Section 5: From Decision Tree to Random Forest Algorithm

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance and reduce overfitting. In this section, we will learn about the concept of the Random Forest algorithm, which involves training multiple decision trees on different subsets of the data and combining their predictions through voting (for classification) or averaging (for regression).
