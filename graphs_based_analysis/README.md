## Introduction

Graphs are powerful representations of relationships and connections between data points in various domains, such as social networks, image analysis, and recommendation systems. This repository aims to provide tools for creating and analyzing graphs, as well as performing useful graph-based analyses.

## Graph Construction from Data Points

This section covers methods to construct graphs from data points. It includes techniques like k-nearest neighbors, epsilon radius, and fully connected graphs, each serving different purposes based on the data characteristics.

## Constructing the Laplacian Matrix

The Laplacian matrix plays a crucial role in graph analysis. We explore how to compute the Laplacian matrix from a given graph and discuss its properties, such as symmetric and positive-semidefinite.

## Spectral Partitioning

Spectral partitioning is an approach to divide a graph into distinct communities based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix. We'll demonstrate how to perform spectral partitioning to identify clusters within a graph.

## Modularity Optimization

Modularity is a measure of the quality of a partitioned graph, indicating how well communities are separated. We'll show how to optimize modularity using techniques like the Louvain algorithm.

## Graph Centrality

Graph centrality measures quantify the importance of nodes within a graph. We'll explore various centrality measures like degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality.
