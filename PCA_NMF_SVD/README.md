## Introduction

Matrix factorization methods are fundamental tools in linear algebra, enabling us to decompose a matrix into smaller components. These techniques find diverse applications in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. In this notebook, we will explore PCA, SVD, and NMF as popular matrix factorization techniques.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining the most important information. It involves finding the principal components (eigenvectors) that capture the maximum variance in the data.

## Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

SVD is another powerful matrix factorization method that decomposes a matrix into three components: U, Î£, and V^T. It allows us to reveal the underlying structure of the data and provides an efficient way to approximate the original matrix with a reduced number of components.

## Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with Lee and Seung's Rule

NMF is a specialized matrix factorization technique used for non-negative data, such as images, audio, and text. We will focus on NMF using Lee and Seung's multiplicative update rule, which is an iterative algorithm to factorize non-negative matrices into non-negative factors.

## Implementation of PCA, SVD, and NMF

In this section, we will implement PCA, SVD, and NMF with Lee and Seung's multiplicative update rule using Python and NumPy. We will also explore their respective strengths and applications.

## Application: Dimensionality Reduction and Data Visualization

Using the implemented matrix factorization techniques, we will apply them to real-world datasets for dimensionality reduction. We will visualize the reduced data and compare the results obtained from PCA, SVD, and NMF.

## Conclusion

In this notebook, we have covered PCA, SVD, and NMF, three powerful matrix factorization methods. We have implemented these techniques using Python and applied them to real-world datasets for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. Understanding and utilizing these matrix factorization techniques can significantly enhance data analysis and machine learning tasks.
