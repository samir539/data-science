# Naive Bayes Classifier

Naive Bayes is a simple and popular classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, with a "naive" assumption that features are conditionally independent given the class. Despite this simplification, Naive Bayes can perform well in many real-world scenarios and is particularly useful for text classification and spam filtering.

## How Naive Bayes Works

Naive Bayes calculates the probability of a data point belonging to a particular class by combining the prior probability of the class and the conditional probabilities of each feature given the class. It assumes that all features are independent of each other, making the calculations computationally efficient.

## Types of Naive Bayes Classifiers

There are several variants of Naive Bayes classifiers, including:
- Gaussian Naive Bayes: Assumes that features follow a Gaussian distribution.
- Multinomial Naive Bayes: Suitable for discrete features, often used for text classification with word frequencies.
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Suitable for binary features, often used for binary text classification.

## Advantages of Naive Bayes

- Simple and easy to implement.
- Requires a small amount of training data to estimate the parameters.
- Fast and computationally efficient.
- Performs well in high-dimensional datasets.

## Limitations of Naive Bayes

- The "naive" assumption of feature independence may not hold true in some cases.
- May suffer from the "zero-frequency problem" with unseen feature values.
- Not well-suited for tasks where interactions between features are essential.

## Usage

To use Naive Bayes, first, preprocess the data and convert it into the appropriate format for the chosen variant (e.g., word frequencies for text data). Then, train the Naive Bayes classifier on the training data. Finally, use the trained classifier to predict the class labels for new data points.
